<div class="about">
<center><h2>Polycate is a free to play 3D multiplayer sandbox game</h2><p>where you can socialize, make new friends, build games, sell virtual items, and many more!</p><br><p>We are currently in development right now.</p><br><h3>We will be creating a sandbox game where you can create games, animations, 3D models, and more! We will be installing some advanced and pretty cool features that will make 3D creations more advanced that anybody can use! We will also use C# for creating games!</h3><br><h3>Our website will be using forums, shops, communities and studios (Premium versions of communities available for partnership). We will also follow user feedback to make our user experience better than ever! We also love to work and play, so we use less automated systems than Youtube, Roblox, and many other leading platforms that need AI to run tasks more than a human. We receive AI reports and we review them. We also want to create a kid-friendly environment without having to ruin other’s experience by having AIs ruin the fun.</h3><br><br><h4>Interested in joining Polycate and creating a new future to gaming and game development?
